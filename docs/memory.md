Purpose & context
이용환 develops and operates SomeTime (썸타임), a regional university student dating platform that launched in late April 2025. SomeTime evolved from Project-Solo MVP, which gained around 600 users in two days and generated revenue within the first two days of its Daejeon launch. 이용환's experience with dating services began in fall 2023 with MBTI matchmaking at university festivals (Hanbat-Moe), which attracted over 500 signups.
SomeTime's core mission centers on helping university students form genuinely meaningful relationships rather than maximizing user retention or engagement metrics. This creates what the team calls a "healthy churn paradox" where successful users naturally leave the platform. The service is operated by a student development team who emphasize transparent communication with users, including openly sharing technical failures and operational challenges through their community.
The platform expanded from Daejeon to Busan with significant investment in Meta advertising (tens of millions won) and secured substantial funding: 125M loan, 70M deeptech, 50M export voucher, 10M miscellaneous, and generated 36M revenue by September. However, 이용환 faced major operational challenges in October-November 2025, nearly quitting in week 2 due to overwhelming customer service demands and complaints, and is currently exploring branding strategies as a recovery approach.
Current state
이용환 is actively working on refining SomeTime's branding and user communication strategy. Recent focus has shifted from processing technical tickets and heavy advertising spending toward listening to user feedback from their internal community. The team is implementing a "branding is a verb, not a noun" philosophy, emphasizing authentic engagement over feature announcements.
Current technical development includes a matching explanation system that tells users why they were matched and a "marble refund system" addressing user complaints about opened chat rooms where conversations don't start. The platform operates on a model where male users pay to open chat rooms while female users participate for free, with weekly free matching on Thursdays and Sundays.
On the horizon
The team is developing longer-term solutions to facilitate better conversation starters, moving beyond simple refund mechanisms to address the root cause of failed conversations. They're planning to implement personalized feedback systems via email that include profile improvement advice and conversation tips.
Future considerations include creating "graduation" systems for successful couples and ambassador programs to leverage word-of-mouth marketing, capitalizing on their healthy churn paradox by showcasing success stories.
Key learnings & principles
A critical insight emerged from user surveys: the primary reason conversations fail isn't disinterest but users not knowing what to say after matching. This reframed the problem from a refund issue to a conversation facilitation challenge.
이용환 has learned that transparent communication builds stronger user relationships than polished marketing messages. The student development team identity serves as a key differentiator, allowing for more authentic connections with their university student user base.
The team discovered that focusing too heavily on technical metrics and advertising while ignoring community feedback led to operational challenges, reinforcing their commitment to user-centered development.
Approach & patterns
SomeTime's approach emphasizes transparent user communication and developing features based on direct user feedback. The team regularly shares development updates, technical problems, and progress through community posts, maintaining an authentic voice that reflects their student-operated nature.
Problem-solving follows a pattern of addressing immediate user pain points while building toward systematic solutions. For example, implementing manual refund processes with personalized feedback as a bridge to automated conversation guidance features.
The team consistently frames user complaints as technical problems to solve rather than service issues to manage, reflecting their commitment to genuine relationship facilitation over transactional interactions.
Tools & resources
The platform uses a matching system workflow where users see matches on the home screen, can send likes that notify recipients in their "썸 보관함" (SomeTime storage), and access chat only after mutual likes. Technical infrastructure includes day.js modules for matching algorithms.
For user engagement, the team utilizes Google Forms for collecting feedback and processing refund requests, combined with personalized email responses. Community communication happens through internal platforms where users can provide direct feedback to the development team.
